#UUID could be hash(first, last, birthday). However, this UUID should not be given away -- it's quite easy to dictionary attack
#If user is tricked into revealing it, it could doxx them. However, this may not be a big deal as it will only doxx the address they prove from
#Advantage of this is interoperability between different ID services; same person would have same UUID
