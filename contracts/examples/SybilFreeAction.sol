This uses an airdrop as an example, but it can be adapted for voting, play-to-earn, play-to-learn, etc.

Example: You want to give an airdrop to all your early users. You want to make your early users get their fare share and far more than they would get if it was just bots swooping up the airdrop and dumping.
